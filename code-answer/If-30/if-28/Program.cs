//If28.Given a number of year (as a positive integer), find the amount of days in the
//year. Note that the length of year is 365 days for an ordinary year and 366 days
//for a leap year. A leap year is every year whose number is divisible by 4,
//as 1980, except centenary years that are not divisible by 400 (for example,
//1300 and 1900 are ordinary years, 1200 and 2000 are leap years).
